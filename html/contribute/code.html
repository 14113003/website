<h2>{% trans "Coding for Wammu and Gammu" %}</h2>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Gammu is written in C and Wammu in <a
href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, so you will need knowledge of one of
these languages to contribute code directly to the project. You will probably
use some parts of <a href="/docs/devel/">developer documentation</a> to
understand the code. If you want to know what is planned to happen in Gammu
and Wammu, please check the <a href="/docs/roadmap/">roadmap</a>.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<a name="vcs"></a>
<h3>{% trans "Version Control System" %}</h3>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
We currently use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> as a version control
system. It allows you create own local branch, develop the code and then
submit us patches or merge request for the changes.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
The Git repositories are being hosted on <a
href="http://gitorious.org/">Gitorious</a> service, having there <a
href="http://gitorious.org/wammu">Wammu</a> and <a
href="http://gitorious.org/gammu">Gammu</a> projects. You can browse the code
on their site or just clone the repository and investigate it locally. To
clone Wammu and Gammu sources, use following commands:
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<pre>
# For Wammu sources:
git clone git://gitorious.org/wammu/mainline.git wammu

# For Gammu sources:
git clone git://gitorious.org/gammu/mainline.git gammu

# For Wammu website:
git clone git://gitorious.org/wammu/website.git wammu_web
</pre>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Alternatively (if your firewall blocks git protocol), you can access
repositories over http, just replace <code>git://gitorious.org/</code> with
<code>http://git.gitorious.org/</code>. All repositories are also mirrored to
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=git&amp;group_id=78290">SourceForge.net</a> 
and repo.or.cz (<a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/gammu.git">Gammu</a> and 
<a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wammu.git">Wammu</a>).
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Instructions for building and installing are included in file
<code>INSTALL</code> in both Gammu and Wammu. For compiling Gammu you need to
have <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans "Code Snapshots" %}</h3>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
If you for some reason do not want to use version control system, you can
always download fresh snapshots of current code. They are available on our
download server - for <a href="http://dl.cihar.com/gammu/snapshot/">Gammu</a>
and <a href="http://dl.cihar.com/wammu/snapshot/">Wammu</a>. These snapshots
are update several times a day, so they should always contain up to date copy
of the code.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>


<h3>{% trans "Patch Submission" %}</h3>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
We really do not care much about the way you deliver us patches. However the
easiest thing is you use <code>git format-patch</code>, which allows us to
easily include your changes. If you do not use git, any unified diff will
serve it's purpose also very well. You can send patches to <a
href="/support/lists/">mailing lists</a> or to the <a
href="/support/bugs/">bug tracker</a>.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<a name="testing"></a>
<h3>{% trans "Testing" %}</h3>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Gammu comes with quite comprehensive testsuite, which is being run daily on
some platforms. You can find results on <a
href="https://cdash.cihar.com/index.php?project=Gammu">CDash</a>. If you have
computer that runs all the time, you are very welcome to run the testsuite and
contribute to the quality of the code. To run the testsuite, you basically
just need checked out <a href="#vcs">sources</a> and run following commands
every night:
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<pre>
cd /path/to/gammu
git pull
cd build-dir # eg. build-configure
make NightlyMemCheck # or just Nightly if memory checking tool is not available on your platform
</pre>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
The results are automatically uploaded to the dashboard and developers are
being notified about every test failure which does happen.
{% endblocktrans %}
