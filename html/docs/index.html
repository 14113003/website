The best user documentation for Gammu comes in form with <a
href="/docs/man/"><strong>man pages</strong></a> within the
program and in <strong><a href="/docs/manual/">The Gammu Manual</a></strong>. 
You can also view man pages <a href="/docs/man/">on this site</a>.
Alternatively some information is available on the <a
href="http://www.gammu.org/">wiki</a>, but it contains outdated content in
many cases.
