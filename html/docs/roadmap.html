<h2>{% trans "Roadmap for Wammu and Gammu" %}</h2>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Neither Gammu nor Wammu do not have fixed release schedule. They are released
when we feel the time has come. On this page you can find what you can expect
in future.

<h3>{% trans "Gammu Roadmap" %}</h3>

<h4>1.27.0</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
This release should mostly contain only bugfixes, no major features are
planned. It should be released around middle of December.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h4>{% trans "Future" %}</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
There are some major issues which should be addressed in Gammu soon. One
problem is locations handling, because current scheme (using numbers) really
does not match majority of current phones and it should be converted to using
path based locations for messages, phonebook, calendar, etc.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
The another major obstacle which is all around Gammu code is own
implementation of unicode (UCS-2-BE) strings. This code should be dropped and
wchar_t used instead.

<h3>{% trans "Wammu Roadmap" %}</h3>

<h4>0.31</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Lot of bug fixes and improvements are already commited for this release. It is
basically just waiting for Gammu 1.27.0 to be released to include it in
Windows binary.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h4>{% trans "Future" %}</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Wammu needs major rewrite in several parts, however developers currently lack
time to do this. On the other side lot of nice to have features depend on
this rewrite and it needs to happen.
