<h3>{% trans "Phones Support" %}</h3>

<h4>{% trans "Is my phone supported?" %}</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Generally any phone capable of AT commands or IrMC should be supported. Also
any Nokia phone using Nokia OS should work. For Symbian please check <a
href="#symbian">separate topic</a>. You can check other user experiences in <a
href="/phones/">Gammu Phones Database</a>.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h4><a name="symbian"></a>{% trans "Are Symbian phones supported?" %}</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Short answer: Not really.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Long answet: For older phones (Symbian 9.0 and older), you can install
gnapplet to phone and access data through it. However gnapplet has not yet
been ported to newer versions, so you have no chance with recent phones. You
can try something what supports SyncML to retrieve contacts or calendar from
your phone, for example <a href="http://www.opensync.org/">OpenSync</a>.

<h3><a name="smsd"></a>{% trans "SMSD" %}</h3>

<h4>{% trans "Which databases does SMSD support?" %}</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
SMSD natively supports <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> and <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. However it has also support
for <a href="http://libdbi.sourceforge.net/">libdbi</a>, which provides access
to wide range of database engines (eg. SQLite, MS SQL Server, Sybase,
Firebird,...). Unfortunately libdbi currently does not work natively on
Microsoft Windows, so you can use it only on Unix platforms.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h4>{% trans "Is there some user interface for SMSD?" %}</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Yes. You can use some of example interfaces distributed with gammu in
<code>contrib</code> directory. Or there is full featured separate interface
written in PHP called <a href="http://kalkun.sourceforge.net/">Kalkun</a>.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3><a name="python"></a>{% trans "Python Bindings" %}</h3>

<h4>{% trans "Where can I download python-gammu?" %}</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
The python-gammu project has been merged into Gammu recently, so you just need
to grab <a href="/download/gammu/">Gammu</a> and it includes python-gammu.
Binaries for Windows are distributed separately.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h4>{% trans "How can I use python-gammu?" %}</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
There are lot of examples shipped with Gammu, you can find them in
<code>python/examples</code> subdirectory.
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans "General" %}</h3>

<h4>{% trans "Will Gammu work on my system?" %}</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Gammu is known to run on wide range of systems. It can be compiled natively on
Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Microsoft Windows. It can be probably
compiled also elsewhere, but nobody has yet tried. On some platforms however
you might lack support for some specific kind of devices (eg. Bluetooth or
USB).
{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h4>{% trans "How to set sender number in message?" %}</h4>
<p>
{% blocktrans %}
You can quite often see messages sent from textual address or with some other
nice looking sender number. However this needs to be done in the GSM network
and it is not possible to influence this from the terminal device (phone).
Usually it is set by SMSC and some network providers allow you to set this
based on some contract. Alternatively you can use their SMS gateways, which
also allow this functionality.
