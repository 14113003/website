You are downloading Gammu binaries for Windows. The files are available as
installer (.exe) or just an archive (.zip). The -Minimal variant has slighly
less features compiled in and contains Gammu.dll, which you might use in
external programs. There are also python-gammu binaries, which include all
needed parts to use python-gammu in your python programs, just choose the
version matching Python version you use.
