You are downloading wammu binaries for Windows. The files are available as
<strong>full installer (-setup.exe)</strong> which is probably the thing you want to download.
If you want to handle all dependencies manually and want to use Python you
have installed, you can get just the <strong>Python module
(.win32.exe)</strong>.
