<h2>{% trans "Support for Wammu and Gammu" %}</h2>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}
Gammu and Wammu are free software projects. As such you can get some support
from the community which is behind the project. The best way where to start is
usually to check <a href="/docs/">documentation</a> whether you problem is not
just a configuration issue or some well known situation.
